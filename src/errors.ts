// Errors that are safe to report, by construction.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// Before telemetry, thrown errors in this app interpolated whatever was useful
// for debugging into the message. That was correct for a console and dangerous
// the moment anything started transmitting. The worst case was real:
//
//   `helloao fetch failed: ${res.status} ${res.statusText} (${usfm} ${chapter})`
//     -> "helloao fetch failed: 404 Not Found (JHN 3)"
//
// "JHN 3" is literally what the person was reading, in a private Bible-study
// journal. Nobody wrote that line carelessly — it predates telemetry by a year.
// That is the whole argument against fixing this by convention: a convention
// cannot reach backwards into code written before it, and a regex blocklist
// fails silently the first time someone writes a message it does not match.
// "JHN 3" is not safely pattern-matchable anyway; neither is "Genesis 1".
//
// THE FIX IS STRUCTURAL, IN THREE LAYERS
//
//  1. A CodedError's `message` IS its stable machine code and nothing else.
//     Any generic handler that reads `.message` — window.onerror, an error
//     boundary, a logging wrapper someone adds next year — gets "BIBLE_FETCH_
//     FAILED" and cannot get anything else, without having to know this file
//     exists.
//
//  2. The human detail lives in a `#private` field. Not a convention: an ES
//     private field is unreachable by every *generic* mechanism a payload
//     builder would plausibly use — `{...err}`, `JSON.stringify(err)`,
//     `Object.keys/entries`, `err['detail']`, structured clone. There is no
//     string you can compute at runtime that reaches it.
//
//  3. The only bridge to the telemetry layer is `toTelemetrySafe()`, which
//     returns a NEW plain object holding exactly three fields. The telemetry
//     payload builder's signature accepts `TelemetrySafeError` and never
//     `Error` or `unknown`, so it does not merely decline to read the detail —
//     it never holds the object the detail is attached to. That is what makes
//     this provable rather than trusted.
//
// Layer 3 is the load-bearing one. Layers 1 and 2 exist so that the guarantee
// still holds on the paths that *don't* go through toTelemetrySafe().
//
// STANDING HAZARD, recorded in TELEMETRY.md and repeated here because this is
// where someone will look: V8 embeds a fragment of its input in JSON.parse
// errors ("Unexpected token 'o', \"{oops}\" is not valid JSON"). A native
// message can therefore leak user content with nobody writing a line of
// interpolation. This app has exactly one JSON.parse, over its own Bible
// bundle, and note content is stored as text via structured clone — clean
// today. Re-check whenever a parse is added over anything a user typed.

 *  - It never reads `.message`. For a CodedError the message is only the code,
 *    which we already have; for a foreign error (a Supabase client error, a
 *    DOM exception, a library throw) the message is arbitrary text written by
 *    someone with no knowledge of this rule, and Postgres in particular will
 *    happily echo a submitted value back inside a constraint-violation
 *    message. So foreign errors contribute their CLASS and their STACK and
 *    nothing else, and get the catch-all code.
 *
 *  - It strips the leading message line(s) from `stack`. V8 formats a stack as
 *    "Name: message\n    at ...", so shipping the raw stack would smuggle the
 *    message back in through the field next to the one we just refused to
 *    read. Only lines that look like frames survive.
