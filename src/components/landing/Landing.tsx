// The public landing page — what an unauthenticated visitor sees. Root's
// signedOut phase used to render a bare SignIn screen with no explanation of
// what the app is; this is that explanation, with sign-in behind a CTA.
//
// Ported from the approved specs in design/ (see design/README.md):
//   - design/lantern-mockup.html   — layout, copy, login direction
//   - design/lantern-hero.html     — the hero animation
//   - design/lantern-features.html — the three feature clips
//
// Deliberate deviations from lantern-mockup.html, which predates two later
// decisions (both noted in BACKLOG):
//   - It draws the retired book+beacon pictorial mark in the nav, footer, and
//     login card. The identity is wordmark-only, so those are <Wordmark />.
//   - Its hero is a static annotated card with its own small CSS animation,
//     superseded by lantern-hero.html's approved flythrough.
//   - Its static "Four lenses" and "Read. Note. Return." sections are replaced
//     by the three feature clips, one of which is Four lenses (owner's call —
//     newest spec wins, no duplicated section).
//
// On the buttons: there is exactly ONE action here. First sign-in doubles as
// sign-up (`shouldCreateUser: true`), so the usual "Get started" vs "Sign in"
// pair would be one door wearing two labels — a SaaS funnel convention borrowed
// into a product with no funnel. The only real choice is *how* to sign in, so
// that is the only choice offered: Google (one click) or email.

              I built Lantern because my own study kept getting lost. Notes in one app, verses in
              another, and nothing where I left it when I came back to a passage a year later. This
              is the tool I wanted: quiet, private, and always beside the text.
