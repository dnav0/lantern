# Architecture

## What this is

Berean is a single-user, web-first PWA for personal Bible-study notes, deployed on
Cloudflare Pages and backed by Supabase (Postgres + auth + RLS). It's a rewrite of
a local-only Electron desktop app. The desktop app carried its whole domain model
and pure-React UI through a single `window.api` bridge with zero direct Electron
imports in the renderer — that bridge is the seam the rewrite pivots on, so the UI
carries over nearly untouched and only the layer behind the seam changes.

## Shape of the app

The UI is a single React tree. `App.tsx` owns view state (which mode, which
passage/book is selected, editor state) and switches between:

- **Capture mode** — reference input + verse pane + note editor.
- **Reading mode** — a passage's notes against its verses, plus a Bible library
  and per-book chapter browser.

There is no router and no global store. State is local to `App.tsx` and passed
down; data comes exclusively through the `BereanApi` context.

### The `BereanApi` seam

All data access and mutation funnels through one interface, `BereanApi`
(`src/api/types.ts`), consumed via `useApi()`. This is the design's load-bearing
decision:

- The implementation swaps without touching components. Phase 0 uses an in-memory
  stub (`memory.ts`); Phase 1 drops in `SupabaseBereanApi` at `main.tsx`.
- It's the single mutation choke point, so the future **offline write outbox** has
  exactly one home. The phase-1 behavior on a failed write — catch, surface a
  friendly message — is literally the stub the outbox replaces later.
- Parent-cleanup cascades (delete note → delete now-empty session → delete
  now-empty passage) are done explicitly in the implementation, matching the old
  desktop `deleteNoteAndCascade` / `deletePassageAll` behavior. In Postgres these
  ride on `ON DELETE CASCADE` for the downward direction; the upward emptiness
  checks stay in `berean-api.ts`.

### The `BibleProvider` seam

Scripture access is a second interface, `src/bible/provider.ts`:
`getChapter(bookNumber, chapter)` → `{ verse, text }[]`. Implemented (Phase 2):

- `src/bible/helloao.ts` — `HelloaoBibleProvider`, BSB via the free, keyless
  `bible.helloao.org` API: `GET /api/BSB/{USFM}/{chapter}.json`. Book numbers
  (1–66) map to helloao's 3-letter USFM codes via an explicit table
  (`USFM_BY_BOOK_NUMBER`) rather than reusing `bibleBooks.ts`'s `id` field,
  because a handful of codes differ (e.g. Ezekiel is `EZK` not `eze`, Joel is
  `JOL`, Nahum is `NAM`, Song of Solomon is `SNG`). The response's
  `chapter.content` is a flat array of typed nodes (`heading`, `line_break`,
  `hebrew_subtitle`, `verse`); a verse's own `content` array mixes plain
  strings with inline objects (`{ noteId }` footnote markers, `{ lineBreak:
  true }`, `{ text, poem }` poetry lines). `flattenVerseContent` reduces all of
  that to one plain-text string per verse — footnote markers and poem-line
  structure aren't surfaced to components today.
- `src/bible/cache.ts` — `CachedBibleProvider` wraps any `BibleProvider` with an
  IndexedDB store (`berean-bible-cache`, key `translation/book/chapter`) and
  caches forever: chapters are immutable, so once fetched, helloao downtime
  never affects a chapter that's already been read.
- `src/bible/service.ts` — the reference-based lookup (`getBibleVerse(reference)
  -> BiblePassage | null`) that components actually call through `BereanApi`.
  It parses a label like `"John 1:1-5"` or `"Genesis 3"` (book prefix via
  `findBookByAlias`, chapter/verse via a regex tailored to the two shapes call
  sites produce), fetches the chapter through the cached provider, and slices
  the requested verse range (or returns the whole chapter when no verse
  component is present). **Design choice:** `getBibleVerse` stayed on
  `BereanApi` (both `memory.ts` and `berean-api.ts` delegate to
  `bible/service.ts`) rather than being removed from the interface and having
  components call the bible module directly — this keeps `BereanApi` as the
  single thing components import for data, avoids call-site churn across
  `CaptureMode`/`NoteEditor`/`ReadingMode`/`BookDetailPage`, and scripture
  lookup is still trivially separable later if it ever needs to move.
- KJV, or ESV-with-user-key, are future providers behind the same
  `BibleProvider` interface — nothing about the seam is BSB-specific except
  `helloao.ts`'s own USFM table.

There is no translation selection anywhere: BSB is the only translation, so no
translation state/props/settings UI exist. The provider interface is the sole
extensibility point for adding one later.

### `platform/`

Anything a native wrapper (Capacitor/Tauri) would reimplement lives behind a
`src/platform/` interface — markdown export now (zip download in the browser),
TTS later. The rule that keeps this honest: no Node/Electron APIs anywhere under
`src/` (see CLAUDE.md).

## Data model

Domain: a **passage** (a scripture reference span) has **sessions**, each holding
ordered **notes**. A note anchors to a verse range, carries an optional category,
and can be a sub-note (`indent_level > 0`). Book identity is a static USFM
`book_number` (1–66) — no books table; `src/utils/bibleBooks.ts` owns all book
metadata client-side.

Key data decisions:

- **Ids are client-generated UUIDs** (`crypto.randomUUID()`) and **timestamps are
  client-set**. This is offline-sync readiness: an offline client can mint a valid
  row and reconcile later without server round-trips for id assignment.
- **`workspace_id` from day one.** Phase 1 only exercises the degenerate
  single-personal-workspace case, but the column and the RLS pattern are in place
  so Groups later is *just new rows* — zero schema or policy migration.

### Target Postgres schema (Supabase, Phase 1)

```sql
-- profiles: 1:1 with auth.users, created by trigger on signup
profiles (id uuid PK refs auth.users, display_name text default '', created_at)

-- workspaces: 'personal' now; 'group' later without migration
workspaces (id uuid PK default gen_random_uuid(),
            kind text check (kind in ('personal','group')),
            name text, created_by uuid refs auth.users, created_at)
workspace_members (workspace_id uuid refs workspaces on delete cascade,
                   user_id uuid refs auth.users on delete cascade,
                   role text default 'owner',
                   PK (workspace_id, user_id))

-- passages: book is a USFM number (1–66); no Books table
passages (id uuid PK, workspace_id uuid refs workspaces on delete cascade,
          book_number int not null check (book_number between 1 and 66),
          chapter_start int, verse_start int, chapter_end int, verse_end int,
          reference_label text not null, created_at timestamptz)

sessions (id uuid PK, passage_id uuid refs passages on delete cascade,
          created_at timestamptz)

notes (id uuid PK, session_id uuid refs sessions on delete cascade,
       content text not null,
       anchor_start_verse int, anchor_end_verse int,
       anchor_book_override text, anchor_chapter_override int,
       category text check (category in
         ('observation','historical','application','personal')),
       indent_level int not null default 0,
       created_by uuid refs auth.users,
       created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz)
```

- **Signup trigger:** on a new `auth.users` row, create a profile + a personal
  workspace + the owner membership.
- **RLS, one pattern everywhere:** a row is visible/writable iff its workspace is
  in `(select workspace_id from workspace_members where user_id = auth.uid())`.
  Notes and sessions check this via a join up to their passage. Groups later add
  membership rows and change nothing about the policies.
- **Not in Postgres:** scripture text (IndexedDB chapter cache) and the old
  `BibleVerseCache` / `Books` tables (replaced by the cache and the client
  `book_number` constant).

## Auth & bootstrap (Phase 1)

Sign-in is **email OTP**: the user enters an email, Supabase sends a 6-digit code,
and the code is verified (`signInWithOtp({ shouldCreateUser: true })` →
`verifyOtp({ type: 'email' })`, `src/api/auth.ts`). First sign-in doubles as
sign-up, which fires the Postgres signup trigger that creates the user's profile,
a personal workspace, and the owner membership. Sessions persist
(`persistSession`, `autoRefreshToken`); sign-out lives in the settings modal.

`src/Root.tsx` is the bootstrap that picks the backend and gates the app:

- **Supabase configured** (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` present)
  → auth-gated. Phases: `loading → signedOut (SignIn) → onboarding (Onboarding) →
  ready (App)`. On a signed-in session it constructs `SupabaseBereanApi.create()`,
  which resolves and caches the user's personal workspace id once, then provides
  it via `ApiProvider`. Onboarding (optional name → capture intro → reading intro,
  skippable) runs on first sign-in and sets `profiles.onboarding_done`
  (localStorage `berean.onboarded` as a fallback).
- **Not configured** → the in-memory stub (`memory.ts`), with a console warning.
  `npm run dev` works with no backend for pure UI work.

`SupabaseBereanApi` (`src/api/berean-api.ts`) is the one mutation choke point:
client-generated `crypto.randomUUID()` ids, client-set ISO timestamps, downward
deletes via `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and the upward empty-session / empty-passage
cleanup done explicitly (mirroring the memory stub and the legacy desktop
`deleteNoteAndCascade`).

### Environment variables

| Var | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `.env` (browser) | Supabase project URL. Absent → memory stub. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `.env` (browser) | Supabase anon/public key. Absent → memory stub. |
| service-role key | CLI arg only | Used by the migration script to bypass RLS. Never in the browser or committed. |

See `.env.example`. `.env` is gitignored.

### SQLite → Supabase migration

`scripts/migrate-sqlite.ts` (run via `npx tsx`; Node APIs allowed here only — the
rest of `src/` stays pure web) does a one-time import of the legacy Electron
`berean.db` into a user's personal workspace. It remaps integer ids → UUIDs
(preserving `created_at`), maps legacy book names → `book_number` via the same
table as `src/utils/bibleBooks.ts`, inserts passages/sessions/notes with the
service-role key, and prints a before/after count summary plus a few sample notes.

```
npx tsx scripts/migrate-sqlite.ts \
  --db ./berean.db \
  --url https://<ref>.supabase.co \
  --service-key <service-role-key> \
  --user-email you@example.com
```

## Offline & PWA (Phase 4)

- Reads work offline: an IndexedDB mirror of the user's notes plus the cached
  scripture chapters means the app opens and reads fully with no network.
- Writes fail gracefully: a failed mutation (detected by fetch failure, not just
  `navigator.onLine`) surfaces a non-blocking "you're offline, changes can't be
  saved yet" message; the UI stays usable read-only. A real write outbox is
  backlog, but the catch point is already the single `BereanApi` choke.
- Markdown export reuses the old vault serialization format, emitted as a zip via
  `platform/export.ts`.
- **iOS PWA note:** every cached thing is re-fetchable (scripture is immutable and
  re-downloadable; notes live in Supabase), so Safari storage eviction is an
  inconvenience, never data loss.

## Responsive & touch (Phase 3)

The app is mobile-first responsive from a single `max-width: 768px` breakpoint in
`src/assets/main.css`. Above it, the original desktop layout is untouched; below
it the shell reflows for a phone (primary target: Android Chrome, ~360–430px).

- **Shell.** The persistent 220px sidebar becomes a **slide-in left drawer** on
  mobile, opened by a hamburger in a fixed top bar (`.mobile-topbar`,
  `.sidebar-host`, `.drawer-backdrop`, all rendered always but shown only under
  the breakpoint). A drawer — not a bottom bar — because the sidebar carries more
  than mode switching: the mode toggle, a scrollable book/passage tree, New
  Passage, and Settings. That doesn't compress into a bar, and a drawer lets the
  exact desktop sidebar content carry over unchanged. Drawer state lives in
  `App.tsx`; any navigation choice closes it (`withCloseDrawer`).
- **Single column.** Capture mode stacks the note editor over the passage pane
  (desktop is a 60/40 split); reading, book detail, session editor, and library
  go full-width with comfortable padding. The library grid drops from 3 to 2
  columns so book names don't truncate.
- **Modals as sheets.** SettingsModal and ConfirmDialog become full-width bottom
  sheets (rounded top, slide-up) on mobile.
- **Functional hovers → tap.** The only functional hover interactions are the
  cross-reference verse previews. `CrossRefPill` (`src/components/CrossRefPill.tsx`)
  centralizes them: on `(hover: hover)` devices it previews on hover exactly as
  before; on touch it's a tap-to-toggle popover that dismisses on outside-tap or
  Escape. Capability is detected with `matchMedia('(hover: hover)')`, not a UA
  sniff, so a hybrid device still gets both. Cosmetic `:hover` styles are left
  as-is (harmless on touch). Hover-revealed action buttons (note edit/delete, the
  verse "+" add button, the sidebar passage-edit pencil) are forced always-visible
  under `@media (hover: none)`.
- **Ergonomics.** All text inputs are ≥16px on mobile (prevents iOS focus zoom);
  touch targets are ≥44px (menu button) or enlarged (icon buttons to 34px, list
  rows padded). `viewport-fit=cover` in `index.html` plus `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
  padding keep content clear of the notch and home indicator. No horizontal
  overflow at 360px (the verse "+" button was pulled inside the row for this).

## Decision log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Web-first PWA, freeze Electron | One codebase runs everywhere; native returns only as a thin Capacitor/Tauri wrapper. Desktop frozen at `v1.2.1-electron-final` on `legacy/electron`. |
| Supabase (Postgres + RLS + email OTP) | Managed auth + row security + Postgres without running infra. Google OAuth links to the same account later via verified email. |
| Single `BereanApi` seam | One swap point for stub→Supabase; one home for the future offline outbox; components stay backend-agnostic. |
| Client UUIDs + client timestamps | Offline-sync readiness — clients mint valid rows without server round-trips. |
| `workspace_id` + membership + single RLS pattern from day one | Groups later is new rows only, no migration. |
| Static `book_number` (1–66), drop Books table | Book metadata is static and belongs client-side; removes a table and its bookkeeping. |
| BSB via helloao, cached forever in IndexedDB | Free, no key; immutable chapters cache indefinitely, so provider downtime doesn't affect reads. Provider interface keeps KJV/ESV addable. |
| `platform/` abstraction + pure-web rule | Keeps the code portable to native wrappers; nothing under `src/` touches Node/Electron. |

## Risks & mitigations

- **RLS correctness** — one policy pattern, verified with a second account
  attempting cross-access.
- **SQLite→Supabase migration fidelity** — tiny dataset; the migration script
  prints a before/after count-and-sample diff, and the legacy branch stays
  runnable as source-of-record until confirmed.
- **helloao dependency** — mitigated by the provider interface + cache-forever;
  self-hosting the BSB dump is a backlog fallback.
