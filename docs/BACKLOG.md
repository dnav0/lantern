# Backlog

Deferred work. This file is the single source of truth for it. **Rule:** whenever
an item is started, finished, or dropped, update this file in the same change —
move completed items to the bottom section, add a line when you defer something
new. Don't let it drift.

Items are roughly ordered by when they're likely to matter, not strictly
prioritized.

## Deferred

- **Offline write outbox.** Queue failed mutations locally and replay them on
  reconnect. The `BereanApi` seam is the single place this slots in — phase-1
  behavior (catch a failed write, show a friendly message) is the stub it
  replaces. Needs conflict handling and last-write-wins (or better) reconciliation
  given client-set timestamps.

- **Custom SMTP for OTP code emails.** Supabase's default email template contains
  only a magic link — the 6-digit code requires adding `{{ .Token }}` to the
  template, which is gated behind custom SMTP (e.g. Resend free tier + a sender
  domain). Until then `detectSessionInUrl: true` accepts the link as the sign-in
  path; the code-entry UI in `SignIn.tsx` already works the moment the template
  includes a code. Revisit before any native wrapper (links are fragile there).

- **Google OAuth.** Add alongside email OTP. Links automatically to the existing
  account via verified email, so no account-merge flow needed.

- **KJV + translation switcher.** Second `BibleProvider` implementation plus a UI
  to pick translation. The provider interface already exists for this; note
  versification papercuts across translations (verse numbers mostly line up).

- **User-key ESV provider.** `BibleProvider` implementation that takes a user's
  own ESV API key (licensing requires per-user keys). Settings UI to store it.

- **Groups / shared workspaces.** Create `kind = 'group'` workspaces and add
  members. The schema (`workspace_id`, `workspace_members`) and the single RLS
  pattern are already in place — this is new rows plus invite/role UI, no
  migration.

- **AI features over notes.** Summaries, thematic linking, question-answering
  across a user's own notes and passages. Needs an embedding/index strategy and a
  cost model.

- **Audio / TTS.** Read scripture and/or notes aloud. Lives behind `platform/` so
  a native wrapper can substitute a device TTS engine.

- **Full-Bible offline prefetch.** Optionally cache the entire BSB into IndexedDB
  up front, rather than lazily per chapter, for guaranteed offline reading.

- **Capacitor mobile wrap.** Package the web app as a native iOS/Android app
  reusing the same code. Platform capabilities (export, TTS) get native
  implementations behind their `platform/` interfaces.

- **Tauri desktop wrap.** Same idea for desktop, replacing the frozen Electron
  app. The web code is the source of truth.

- **Self-hosted BSB fallback.** Host the BSB dump ourselves so reads don't depend
  on `bible.helloao.org` availability. Cache-forever already blunts this risk;
  this removes it.

- **Paid tier considerations.** If/when hosting or AI costs warrant it: what's
  free vs paid, billing, quota enforcement. Design the free single-user
  experience so it never feels crippled.

- **Note→study bridge in the chapter reading view.** Workstream 2 added "Open
  study" on notes in `ReadingMode` (saved-passage view), where the passage is
  known. Notes rendered inside `BookDetailPage`'s ChapterView carry no passage
  id (`NoteWithPassageInfo` has only `reference_label`), so the same bridge
  there needs a note→passage resolution step first.

## Done

- **Mobile study layout (UX overhaul, workstream 5).** On mobile (<=768px) the
  scripture pane is now a pinned, collapsible panel at the TOP of the study view
  (`StudyMode`): it peeks (~34vh) by default and expands (~62vh) on tapping its
  header, which shows the loaded reference + a chevron. It scrolls internally and
  never scrolls fully off-screen; notes render below it and scroll independently.
  Achieved with CSS only (flex `order: -1`, bounded `max-height`, a
  `.study-scripture-body` wrapper that is `display: contents` on desktop so the
  side-by-side layout is untouched) plus one `scriptureExpanded` state + toggle
  header in `StudyMode`. Desktop side-by-side (`.study-left`/`.study-right`) is
  unchanged (toggle hidden). Caret-visible-above-keyboard: `NoteEditor`'s
  `scrollLineIntoView` gained a `keyboardAware` mode that clamps the effective
  container bottom to `visualViewport.offsetTop + height`; a `visualViewport`
  resize/scroll listener (keyed to the focused line) and the input handler re-run
  it so the caret stays above the soft keyboard as lines wrap/add. No-op where the
  API is absent (desktop). Add-on: an extremely subtle note timestamp
  (`.note-timestamp`, muted 10px, trailing edge) rendered on note cards in
  `ReadingMode` and `SessionEditor` via a shared `formatRelativeTime` helper
  (`src/utils/relativeTime.ts`), using `updated_at` (falling back to
  `created_at`). No schema or `BereanApi` changes. NOTE for future: timestamps are
  intentionally NOT shown on the ephemeral `NoteEditor` editing lines (those rows
  carry no persisted timestamp) — only on rendered/persisted note cards.

- **Editor behaviors (UX overhaul, workstream 4).** Reference field commits on
  Enter/Tab and moves focus to the first note line *immediately* (synchronous —
  never on the async verse fetch); parse failure keeps focus in the field and
  shows an inline error; `enterKeyHint="go"` for mobile. `ReferenceInput.onSubmit`
  now returns a boolean so the field can decide focus-vs-error, and `StudyMode`
  bumps a `focusNonce` prop the `NoteEditor` watches to imperatively focus the
  target line. Outdent rules in `NoteEditor` keydown: Enter on an empty bullet at
  indent > 0 outdents in place (keeps the bullet, no new line); Enter on an empty
  level-0 bullet is a no-op; Backspace at the start of an empty indented bullet
  also outdents; Shift+Tab unchanged. The keydown *decisions* were extracted to a
  pure module (`src/utils/noteKeydown.ts`) so they're unit-testable without a
  contenteditable — tag parsing stayed in `noteParser.ts`, layers kept separate.
  Tag discoverability (all passive): every empty note line shows the placeholder
  "Type your note — @ for a category, v4 to tag verse 4"; recognized tags render
  as pills as parsed (already the case); a one-time first-use hint popover fires
  on first note-line focus (localStorage flag `berean.noteHintSeen`); a mobile
  chip row above the keyboard offers tap-to-insert for verse/category tags (same
  data model, input method only — desktop hides it). Test infra added: Vitest
  (`npm test` → `vitest run`), covering the keydown decisions and a regression
  pin on `@`-tag + verse parsing. No schema or `BereanApi` changes.

- **Study entry points + verse-range selection (UX overhaul, workstream 3).**
  Renamed Capture→Study across UI copy and code (`CaptureMode`→`StudyMode`
  component/handle, App state `capture*`→`study*`, `.capture-*` CSS →
  `.study-*`, `btn-capture-chapter`→`btn-study-chapter`, Onboarding "Study
  mode", chapter button "Study chapter"). Three convergent entry points to the
  same `StudyMode`: blank from the nav, prefilled from the current chapter
  ("Study chapter"), and verse-range selection in the Bible chapter reader
  (`BookDetailPage` ChapterView) — tap a verse to start, tap another to extend,
  a floating action bar offers "Start study on {ref}" (prefills StudyMode with
  the exact range) and "Quick note" (opens the inline note input prefilled with
  the verse-range tag). Quick note reuses the existing session+note flow — no
  schema or `BereanApi` change. The floating bar clears via its × or by tapping
  the sole selected verse again; on mobile it floats above the bottom tab bar. Journal is a
  browseable index of studies grouped by book (newest first within a group;
  reference, date, note count, first-line preview) via a new
  `BereanApi.getJournalEntries()` (implemented in both `SupabaseBereanApi` and
  the memory stub); tapping a row opens the study in `SessionEditor`. Notes in
  `ReadingMode` now offer "Edit note" and "Open study" (jumps to the
  SessionEditor under the Journal destination).

- **Nav restructure (UX overhaul, workstream 1).** Sidebar/drawer removed; top
  nav (desktop) + bottom tab bar (mobile) with Bible · Journal · + Study ·
  Profile; workspace-selector stub ("Personal ▾"); avatar/profile menu absorbing
  the Settings entry point; Bible library is home. Journal is a placeholder
  until workstream 2.
