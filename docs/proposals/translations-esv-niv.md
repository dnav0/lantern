# ESV & NIV translations — licensing reality + implementation path

Status: **research only, no application code.** This document answers the
brief: for ESV, NIV, and KJV (the zero-friction comparison), what the
*current* licensing terms actually say, verified against primary sources
rather than assumed — and what it would cost `BibleProvider` to host any of
them alongside the cache-forever, self-hosted-fallback BSB setup that only
works today because BSB is public domain.

## tl;dr

- **The gating question is licensing, not engineering, and the terms are
  less generous than "there's an API" implies.** ESV and NIV both cap how
  much text you may cache locally and forbid the self-hosted offline
  fallback outright — both pillars of Lantern's current scripture
  architecture (`docs/BACKLOG.md`'s "Full-Bible offline prefetch" and the
  shipped self-hosted BSB fallback) are legal *only* because BSB is public
  domain.
- **The backlog's open question is resolved: the ESV API is ONE
  application-level key, not per-user keys.** Crossway's own docs and terms
  say requests are authenticated per *application* (`api.esv.org/account/`
  → "Create an API application"), rate limits are enforced per application/
  organization, and the key must not be shared or published — the "User-key
  ESV provider" backlog item's premise ("licensing requires per-user keys")
  is wrong and should be corrected.
- **NIV is real but the worst fit of the three.** A free, non-commercial API
  path exists (API.Bible / American Bible Society), correcting this brief's
  own steelman ("NIV likely has no free public API") — but Biblica's terms
  layer a heavier, more subjective review on top of price, commercial use is
  blocked outright with no published unlock price, and it's genuinely
  unclear whether a full Bible-reading app is even the "quotation" use case
  Biblica's blanket permission was written for.
- **KJV has zero licensing friction**, identical in kind to BSB (public
  domain in the US) — it is a "when wanted" ship, not a "can we" question.
- **Recommendation, in order: KJV now if wanted, ESV as a real second
  translation with bounded new engineering, NIV not now** — see
  [Recommendation](#4-recommendation).

## 1. Licensing reality per translation (as checked 2026-07-22)

### KJV — zero friction (the comparison baseline)

The 1611 King James Version is public domain in the United States and most
of the world; only the United Kingdom carries a standing exception (perpetual
Crown copyright administered by Cambridge University Press, Oxford
University Press, and Collins as the Letters-Patent holders, allowing "a
maximum of five hundred (500) verses for liturgical and non-commercial
educational use" without permission inside the UK) — a restriction that has
no effect outside the UK and that Lantern, a US-hosted app with no
UK-specific distribution, is not subject to
([sellingjesus.org/articles/kjv](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/kjv), as
checked 2026-07-22). One caveat that matters if a *specific* KJV text file is
ever sourced: annotated/study editions (added notes, cross-references,
reformatted paragraphing) can carry their own derivative-work copyright even
where the base 1611 text doesn't — so the bare text (no apparatus) is the
only part guaranteed public domain, exactly the same caveat BSB already
navigates by shipping plain verse text with no commentary.

**Verdict: identical legal shape to BSB.** No API key, no attribution
requirement, no cache cap, no rate limit, and a self-hosted static bundle
(the same pattern `scripts/build-bsb-bundle.mjs` + `self-hosted.ts` already
proves) is fully legal.

### ESV — free, single application key, hard caps

checked 2026-07-22.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Legally displayable in a free, non-commercial, single-operator app | **Yes.** "Crossway allows you to access the ESV Bible text from our server and include it on your website or app, free of charge for non-commercial use." |
| Per-application vs per-user keys | **Per-application.** You register one "API application" at `api.esv.org/account/`; the key authenticates that application, not individual end users. This is the backlog's open question, resolved. |
| Approval step | Account creation is self-serve, but the application itself is subject to staff review before a key is issued — not instant, but not a negotiated commercial contract either. |
| Cached/stored locally | **Capped, not unlimited.** Up to 500 verses, or half of any one book of the Bible, whichever is smaller — stated as a *storage* limit, distinct from the per-query cap below. |
| Verse-count cap per query | Same ceiling: max 500 verses or half a book per request/page. |
| Attribution | Required on every quotation: the letters "ESV," a link to `www.esv.org`, plus a dedicated copyright-notice page ("Scripture quotations are from the ESV® Bible... © 2001 by Crossway..."). |
| Rate/quota limits | 5,000 queries/day, 1,000/hour, 60/minute — enforced **per application**, i.e. shared across every Lantern user simultaneously, not a budget each user gets individually. |
| Cost / commercial path | Free tier covers non-commercial use as described above. Exceeding the guidelines (e.g., wanting the caps lifted) requires a separate, formally negotiated license, and Crossway's own language for that tier explicitly distinguishes "organizations" from "individuals or solo developers" — the expanded tier is not realistically available to a single-operator app; the free self-serve tier is the only path that fits Lantern. |
| Key handling | The key "may not be sold, shared, or published" — it cannot ship inside client-side code; it has to sit behind a server Lantern controls. |

**Verdict: viable.** The terms are restrictive but knowable, self-serve, and
compatible with what Lantern is today (free, non-commercial, one operator).

### NIV — a free tier exists, but it's the worst fit of the three

/
[docs.api.bible/guides/bibles/](https://docs.api.bible/guides/bibles/) (API.Bible,
the American Bible Society's platform) — all as checked 2026-07-22.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Legally displayable in a free, non-commercial, single-operator app | **Conditionally yes, but narrower than it looks.** Biblica's own blanket permission lets anyone quote up to 500 verses / under 25% of a work / not a whole book, *without* applying — but that's written for quoting NIV text **inside another work** (an article, a sermon, a book), not for building an app whose entire purpose is serving the complete translation across every book, which is what a Bible-reading app structurally does over time. It is genuinely unclear the blanket grant covers Lantern's actual usage pattern; API.Bible is the documented app-shaped path instead (below). |
| Free API path | **Yes — this brief's own steelman ("NIV likely has no free public API") was wrong and is corrected here.** API.Bible's free Starter plan lets a non-commercial app choose up to 3 licensed Bibles (NIV can be one) alongside hundreds of open-access translations, at 500 verses/query and 5,000 queries/day. |
| Per-application vs per-user keys | Per-application, same shape as ESV (a single API key authenticates the registered app). |
| Cached/stored locally, verse-count cap | The 500-verse **per-query** cap is documented; **no explicit local-storage/caching cap distinct from that figure was found** for API.Bible, unlike ESV's explicit separate storage limit. Treat the per-query figure as the presumptive ceiling for planning purposes, but confirm the actual storage clause in API.Bible's full Terms of Service before writing a cache design against it — this brief did not locate that clause and is not asserting one. |
| Attribution | "Scripture quotations taken from The Holy Bible, New International Version® NIV® Copyright © 1973 1978 1984 2011 by Biblica, Inc.™ Used by permission," required on the title/copyright page (a lighter "(NIV)" tag suffices only for non-saleable church materials, which doesn't describe a public web/app product). |
| Rate/quota limits | 5,000 queries/day on the free Starter tier (same order of magnitude as ESV). |
| Cost / commercial path | **Blocked outright, not just gated by price.** "NIV commercial use is not available" through API.Bible at any tier — other copyrighted translations there can be licensed commercially from $10/month, but NIV is carved out entirely. Any future commercial use of NIV would require a separate, direct, negotiated agreement with Biblica, with no published price or self-serve process. |
| Approval step | Heavier than ESV's. Beyond simple API signup, Biblica's own permissions language for its content generally references conditions around "intellectual property protection, theological integrity, security safeguards, human oversight, permissible functionality" — a subjective, content-review-flavored bar, not just a rate-limit-and-attribution checklist. |

**Verdict up front (the brief's required honest take): NIV is technically
obtainable for free today for a non-commercial app, but it is the worst
translation of the three to add.** It carries ESV's caps and per-application
key model *plus* a heavier and more subjective approval relationship with
its rights holder, a real ambiguity about whether "app" is even the licensed
use case, an unverified caching ceiling, and a hard, price-free wall the
moment Lantern ever charges for anything. See
[Recommendation](#4-recommendation) for what it would take to revisit.

## 2. The architecture collision

Lantern's current scripture stack (`src/bible/service.ts`) is:

```
production = FallbackBibleProvider(
  CachedBibleProvider(HelloaoBibleProvider()),   // cache-forever, IndexedDB
  SelfHostedBibleProvider()                       // complete BSB, static bundle, lazy fallback
)
```

Both halves of that composition are legal *only* because BSB is public
domain:

- **Cache-forever breaks on ESV, and presumptively on NIV.**
  `CachedBibleProvider` (`src/bible/cache.ts`) has no eviction — every
  chapter ever fetched is written to `berean-bible-cache` and kept forever,
  by design ("chapters are immutable, so once fetched they're cached
  forever"). ESV's terms cap local storage at 500 verses / half a book,
  full stop; a user who reads three or four chapters is already near that
  ceiling. NIV's per-query cap is the same order of magnitude and, absent a
  confirmed storage-specific clause, should be assumed at least as strict.
  A translation-aware cache needs a real eviction policy (LRU by
  translation, most likely) that does not exist today — BSB keeps
  unlimited growth, ESV/NIV cannot.
- **The self-hosted offline fallback is categorically impossible for
  copyrighted text.** `self-hosted.ts` exists because BSB is public domain —
  shipping the *entire* translation as a static build artifact
  (`public/bible/bsb.json.gz`) is exactly the mass-reproduction/distribution
  that ESV's and NIV's terms exist to prevent; there is no equivalent bundle
  strategy available for either. Concretely: **offline reading of ESV or NIV
  is license-blocked, not just unbuilt.** A helloao-equivalent outage or a
  genuinely offline user reading BSB today degrades gracefully (self-hosted
  fallback, or nothing if truly offline per the "Full-Bible offline
  prefetch" backlog item); the same failure for ESV/NIV has to fail outright
  with an honest message, because there is no fallback available to build.
- **`BibleProvider`'s interface itself needs to grow a translation
  dimension.** `provider.ts`'s `getChapter(bookNumber, chapter)` has no
  translation parameter today — the single hardcoded `TRANSLATION = 'BSB'`
  constant lives inside `cache.ts`, and `service.ts` wires exactly one fixed
  provider pipeline. Supporting a second translation means: (a)
  `getChapter` takes a translation argument; (b) `service.ts` becomes a
  per-translation lookup rather than one fixed composition — BSB keeps
  `FallbackBibleProvider(cache(helloao), selfHosted)` unchanged, while
  ESV/NIV get a narrower composition with no self-hosted stage and a
  quota-aware (evicting) cache instead of an unbounded one; (c) the ESV/NIV
  API key cannot live in client code (both terms forbid publishing/sharing
  it, and it's an application-level credential, not a per-user one) — this
  needs a small server-side proxy, following the precedent
  `supabase/functions/hq-telemetry` already set for keeping a secret out of
  the browser, which is new infrastructure `BibleProvider` doesn't need for
  BSB at all; (d) because the ~5,000/day rate limit is shared across every
  Lantern user (application-level, not per-user), the new provider needs an
  explicit degrade path — "translation temporarily unavailable, try BSB" —
  that nothing in the current stack needs, since helloao has no comparable
  shared ceiling.

## 3. Versification and the translation-switcher UX

**Verse-anchored notes mostly survive a translation switch, but not
perfectly.** KJV, ESV, NIV, and BSB all follow the same broad
English-Bible versification convention, so a note anchored to "John 3:16"
resolves to the same verse in any of them in the overwhelming majority of
cases. The known papercuts:

- **NIV keeps disputed-passage verse numbers rather than deleting them.**
  Mark 16:9–20 and John 7:53–8:11 (among others) are present with their
  traditional verse numbers but flagged as a footnoted/bracketed manuscript
  note rather than silently renumbered or omitted — so a `{verse, text}`
  chapter row exists for those verses in the NIV, but its *text* may need to
  represent "present but disputed" rather than plain body text. This is a
  UI/rendering nuance the current chapter view doesn't have, not a
  missing-data problem.
- **A verse a user's note is anchored to can be genuinely absent** from a
  different translation's chapter data (this is a real possibility across
  any two independently-versified sources, even if none of the three specific
  translations here are confirmed to drop a verse Lantern's BSB has). The
  note-rendering path needs a defined "not present in this translation"
  degrade — today's code has never needed one, because BSB has been the only
  translation.

**Translation-switcher UX, answered for the acceptance criteria:**

- **Default stays BSB.** Zero licensing risk, already the deep default, no
  reason to change it even once a second translation ships.
- **Selection scope: global, not per-passage.** Per-passage switching would
  multiply the quota/eviction/degrade complexity above *per open passage*
  for a capability nobody has asked for; a single global preference (like
  theme) is the only sane v1.
- **Storage: a new localStorage key alongside the existing
  `berean-theme`/`berean-visual-theme` pattern** (e.g. `berean-translation`),
  kept local-only (not synced through `BereanApi`/Supabase) initially,
  matching exactly how theme preference already works — there's no existing
  precedent or request for cross-device sync of this particular preference.

## 4. Recommendation

This is a stance, not a menu.

1. **KJV — ship whenever wanted, no blocker.** Same legal shape as BSB:
   public domain, no key, no cap, no attribution, self-hosted bundle works
   exactly like `bsb.json.gz` does today. This is the cheapest possible
   second `BibleProvider` and the backlog item's original framing already
   had this right.
2. **ESV — ship second, if/when Dennis wants a real second translation.**
   Genuinely viable for a free single-operator app: one self-serve
   application key (not per-user — correcting the backlog's premise),
   non-commercial use fits Lantern as it exists today, and the engineering
   cost, while real, is bounded and enumerated above (translation param on
   the seam, quota-aware evicting cache, server-side key proxy, shared-quota
   degrade path, no offline fallback). Not a small change, but a scoped one.
3. **NIV — do not build now.** Honest verdict: technically free and
   obtainable today via API.Bible for non-commercial use, but it is the
   worse translation to add on every axis that matters here — heavier and
   more subjective approval relationship with Biblica, real ambiguity about
   whether a reading app is even the licensed use case, an unconfirmed
   caching ceiling (so the architecture work above can't even be fully
   scoped yet), and a hard, priceless wall against ever monetizing anything
   while NIV is in the app. If it's ever wanted: (a) go directly to
   Biblica's permission-request process (not just API.Bible self-serve
   signup) and get written confirmation that a full Bible-reading PWA is a
   "permissible functionality" under their terms, since the blanket
   quotation grant doesn't obviously cover it; (b) get an explicit answer on
   local/offline storage limits before designing a cache against them; (c)
   accept, going in, that NIV is permanently non-commercial-only for Lantern
   absent a separate negotiation.

**Defer:** the seam refactor itself (translation-parameterized
`BibleProvider`, quota-aware cache, key-proxy edge function) should not be
built speculatively ahead of a translation actually shipping — it's real
work with no value until ESV or KJV is the concrete next task.

## Trigger to revisit

- **ESV:** build when Dennis actually wants a second translation for a real
  reason (not "more translations" in the abstract) — licensing is confirmed
  workable today, so the only remaining question is whether it's worth the
  bounded engineering cost above.
- **NIV:** revisit only if (a) a real user asks for NIV specifically, not
  translations generically, **and** (b) Dennis is willing to spend the time
  getting Biblica's direct written confirmation that an app is licensable
  under their terms — do not build against the assumption that API.Bible's
  self-serve grant is safe for a full reading app's actual usage pattern
  without that confirmation, and do not build a cache against an unconfirmed
  storage cap.
- **KJV:** no trigger needed beyond "wanted" — identical risk profile to
  BSB, free to build any time.
